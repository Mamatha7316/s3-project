## Implementing AWS S3 Bucket Policies for Access Control

This project focuses on setting up and managing AWS S3 bucket policies to control access to objects stored in S3. The objective is to define fine-grained permissions at the bucket and object level to ensure secure and appropriate access for users, applications, and services.

## Key tasks include:
  -  Creating and configuring S3 buckets.
  -  Writing custom bucket policies to allow or restrict access based on IAM roles, users, or specific IP addresses.
  -  Implementing policies to support different use cases, such as public access, cross-account access, and restricting access by region.
  -  Testing the policies to ensure they meet security requirements and compliance standards.

The project demonstrates how to securely manage access to AWS S3 resources, ensuring that only authorized users or services can access sensitive data stored in the cloud.
